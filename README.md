# Moving-CutOff-Screening-Test
This Shiny App has a dual normal distribution chart, and 
it demonstrates changes in cutoffs and evaluates its impact on Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, and NPV which are key statistics of the Screening Test 
with a nice visualization in stacked bar chart and contingency tables before and after the change in the cutoff.
